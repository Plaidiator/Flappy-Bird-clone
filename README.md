# Flappy-Bird-clone

I did this project based on a tutorial from Zigurous on YouTube. The goal of this project for me was to learn the basics of 2D unity games. I followed the tutorial and used assets, then played with some of the scripts to make the game more playable. I also made it functional in the Unity Android client with touch controls.
